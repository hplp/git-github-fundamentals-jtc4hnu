I am very familiar with version control and Github.

I already knew the mechanics of Repositories, Branching, Forks, and Pull Requests. Issues is not a feature I have used extensively, but it was good to read about.

Engaging in the GitHub communities is an interesting aspect. I have not used GitHub to explore communities or other developers, but may be something I look into further.
